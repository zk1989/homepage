My code in this repository doesn't include some of the state-of-the-art practices and approaches in front-end area.
It's because I'm not professionally a front-end developer.
I made this for fun and to have some basic experience of creating a static website.
So I've only used HTML, CSS, and JavaScript concepts that I currently understand.
